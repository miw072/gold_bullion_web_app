In our implementation of HTML/CSS template building, we used standard HTML5 and CSS to build wireframes provided by the professor. In general , we built 6 pages. In these pages, we use both inline css style and document wide css style. 
At the beginning of some html pages, we wrote document wide css to regulate the font style and size for all body part. The nav.tab css part is used for defining the navigation tabs. These tabs are for switching from table data to image data in mobile phone mode.
In our implementation, we consider different conditions for different sizes of the devices and browsers. According to the wireframes template, we implemented for large, middle, small and extra-small windows for different display. As you can see, our template works fine when you use PC browsers and mobile phone browsers. In detail, we changed the size of each part and hidden some parts when switching from middle/large size to small/extra-small size. We also added some navigation tabs for users.
The css we used in this implementation is bootstrap. The most important feature in bootstrap is the Grid System. Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. In all of our pages, we use this feature to control the physical layout flows.
